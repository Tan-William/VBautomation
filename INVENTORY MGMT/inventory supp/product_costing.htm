<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="5">Classification of Costs in 
Products Manufacturing</font></b></p>
<p>We can classify costs according to these three elements: </p>
<ul>
	<li>materials             
	</li>
	<li>labour             
	</li>
	<li>expenses or overheads </li>
</ul>
<p>We can also classify costs into two types - Product and Period Costs.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Product costs - the costs of manufacturing our products; or             
	</li>
	<li>Period costs - the costs other than product costs that are charged to, 
	debited to, or written off to the income statement each period. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">The Classification of Product Costs</font> </b></p>
<p><b><u>Direct costs</u> </b></p>
<p>Direct costs are generally seen as variable costs because they are directly 
associated with manufacturing. Direct costs include direct materials (raw 
materials), direct labour ( machine operators) and direct expenses (royalties 
paid, etc). <i>Prime Cost </i>is the aggregate of all direct costs. <i>Overhead</i> 
is the aggregate of all indirect costs. <i>Total Product Cost </i>is the sum of 
prime cost and overheads.</p>
<p><b><u>Indirect Costs </u></b></p>
<p>Indirect costs are those costs that are incurred in the factory but that 
cannot be directly associate with manufacture. Again, these costs are classified 
according to the three elements of cost - materials, labour and overheads. </p>
<p><u>1) indirect materials</u><br>
Some materials are on the edge of being direct or indirect material costs. You 
have to know you products and processes well before you classify them. Example 
of indirect material costs includes lubricants, cleaning materials, etc.</p>
<p><u>2) indirect labour</u><br>
It includes labour costs of people who are only indirectly associated with 
manufacture (managers, supervisors, operators, technicians, etc).</p>
<p><u>3) indirect expenses</u><br>
Essentially, if a cost is a factory cost and it has not been included in any of 
the other sections, it has to be an indirect expense. For example, the 
depreciation of equipment, machinery, vehicles, buildings electricity, water, 
telephone, rent, tax, insurance, etc. Total indirect costs are collectively 
known as Overheads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">The Classification of Period Costs </font></b></p>
<p>The classification of Period costs varies according to the types of 
organisation and the industry. They includes:</p>
<p><u>1) Administration costs</u><br>
These are the costs of running the administrative aspects of an organisation. 
(example: salaries, rent, tax, electricity, water, telephone, depreciation, etc)</p>
<p>2) Sales and Distribution costs<br>
The costs of distribution and selling (example: advertising, market research, 
salaries, bonuses, electricity, and so on) are all accumulated in a similar way 
in which Administration costs are accumulated.</p>
<p><u>3) Finance Costs</u><br>
These are those costs associated with providing the permanent, long term and 
short term finance. (example: within the section headed finance costs we will 
find dividends, interest on long term loans and interest on short term loans).
</p>
<p>In deed you can add any number of sub-classifications depends on the ways in 
which your organisation operates and how you want to refine cost analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Fixed v Variable costs</font></b><br>
<br>
Fixed costs are expenses whose total does not change in proportion to the 
activity of a business, within the relevant time period or scale of production. 
Examples of fixed costs are overheads (rent, insurance etc), monthly salary of 
the managers, monthly deprecation of a single machine. Fixed costs are 
irrelevant for short-term decisions, as fixed costs do not change if more or 
less products or services are sold. <br>
<br>
Variable costs vary in direct proportion to changes in the level of activity. 
This means that if the activity level doubles, then the variable cost will 
double. Examples of variable costs are direct material, direct labour and direct 
expenses. In comparison with fixed costs, variable costs do vary with the level 
of production or services provided. They are relevant for short-term decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Marginal and Absorption Costing</font></b></p>
<p>Marginal costing is a costing technique where each unit of output is charged 
with variable production costs. Marginal costing also shows the effect on profit 
of changes in volume/type of output by differentiating between fixed and 
variable costs. Fixed production costs are not considered to be real costs of 
production, but just enabling the production to take place. They are treated as 
costs of the period and charged to the period in which they are incurred.</p>
<p>Marginal costing is contrasted with absorption costing, which is a costing 
technique where each unit of output is charged with both fixed and variable 
production costs. Unlike marginal costing, with absorption costing stock is 
valued on a full production cost basis. When stock is sold in the next 
accounting period these costs are released and matched with the revenue of that 
period.</p>
<p>Looking at marginal and absorption costing this can be tied into the various 
cost classifications that has been discussed in the assignment. Marginal costing 
can be linked in with using relevant costing classification, as the methods of 
marginal costing aid managerial decisions which is also used with relevant and 
irrelevant costing. Absorption costing can be compared with the method of fixed 
v variable costing. This is due to the fact that absorption costing recognized 
the importance of fixed costs in production. However, marginal costing can also 
be compared with the costing classification of fixed v variable cost are this 
again is used to separate fixed and variable costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Activity-Based Costing (ABC)</font></b></p>
<p>Activity Based Costing (ABC) emphasizes the need to obtain a better 
understanding of the behavior of overhead costs, and thus ascertains what causes 
overhead to occur and how they relate products. ABC recognizes that in the long 
run most costs are not fixed, and it seeks to understand the forces that cause 
overhead costs to change overtime.</p>
<p>ABC systems assume that activities cause costs and also that products or 
services create demands for activities. ABC is simply a more rigours abspotion 
costing. This means instead of all the overhead being recovered on a single 
basis (i.e. labour hours) ABC recognizes that different overheads are driven by 
different factors (cost drivers). </p>
<p>ABC not only links in with marginal and absorption costing, but also with 
fixed v variable cost classifications. For example, ABC takes into account 
overheads that change over time, which is what is incurred during fixed vs 
variable costs. This is due to the fact that even though ABC does recognize 
fixed cost, it understands that there is variable cost such as direct labour. 
This links in with both marginal costing, by separating fixed and variable 
costs, as well as absorption costing, recognizing the importance of fixed costs.</p>
