		<font face="Arial" size="6"><strong>The Product Life Cycle</strong></font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">The duration of product's life cycle may be 
		as short as a few months for a fad item or many years for some product 
		categories.</font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">After a period of design and development the product is 
		introduced or launched into the market; it gains more and more customers 
		as it grows; eventually the market stabilizes and the product becomes 
		mature; then after a period of time the product is overtaken by 
		development and the introduction of superior competitors, it goes into 
		decline and is eventually withdrawn. However, most products fail in the 
		introduction phase. Others have very cyclical maturity phases where 
		declines see the product promoted to regain customers.</font></p>
		<p align="center">
		<font face="Arial" size="2">
		<img border="0" src="../images/productlifecycle.gif" width="308" height="254"></font></p>
		<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial">Strategies for the 
		differing stages of the Product Life Cycle.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Introduction</b> <b>stage</b>.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">The product is promoted to create awareness 
		and its benefits. The higher costs coupled with low sales volume usually 
		make the introduction stage a period of negative profits. The primary 
		goal is to establish a market and build primary demand for the product. If the product 
		has no or few competitors, a skimming price strategy is employed. 
		Limited numbers of product are available in few channels of 
		distribution.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Growth</b> <b>stage</b>.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Competitors are attracted into the market 
		with very similar offerings. Products at this stage enjoy rapid revenue 
		growth, and 
		companies form alliances and joint ventures. 
		Advertising spend is high and focuses upon building brand. Market share 
		tends to stabilize.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Maturity</b> <b>stage</b>.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">During maturity stage, the primary goal 
		is to maintain market share and extend the product life cycle. Products that survive the earlier 
		stages tend to spend longest in this phase. Sales grow at a decreasing 
		rate and then stabilize. Producers attempt to differentiate products and 
		brands are key to this. Price wars and intense competition occur. At 
		this point the market reaches saturation. Producers begin to leave the 
		market due to poor margins. Promotion becomes more widespread and use a 
		greater variety of media.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Decline</b> <b>stage</b>.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">At this stage there is a downturn in the 
		market. Sales declines as market becomes saturated, the product becomes 
		technologically obsolete, more innovative products are introduced or 
		consumer tastes have changed. There is intense price-cutting and many more 
		products are withdrawn from the market. Profits can be improved by 
		reducing marketing spend and cost cutting.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Problems with Product Life Cycle.</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">In reality very few products follow such 
		a prescriptive cycle. The length of each stage varies enormously. The 
		decisions of marketers can change the stage, for example from maturity 
		to decline by price-cutting. Not all products go through each stage. 
		Some go from introduction to decline. It is not easy to tell which stage 
		the product is in.</font></td>
