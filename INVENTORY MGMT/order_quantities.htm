Order Quantities </span></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;">
<font size="2" face="Arial" class="auto-style1">To 
determine<span> the right Economic Order Quantities </span>(EOQ, also known as 
lot sizing) and related&nbsp;cost-based lot sizing methods is actually rather simple 
calculation with an Excel spreadsheet. <span>Many ERP packages come with built 
in calculations for EOQ which calculate automatically. Often the users do not 
understand how it is calculated and therefore do not understand the data inputs 
and system setup which controls the output. </span>Once you understand the 
workings of cost-based lot sizing, you can use that knowledge to put together 
your own system that meets your specific business needs.&nbsp;But note that <span>
often time, these built-in EOQ calculations are inadequate, and in need of 
modifications to deal with the diversity of multi product groups and processes.
</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;"><font face="Arial">
<span style class="auto-style1">EOQ is essentially an accounting formula that determines&nbsp;the point 
at which the combination of&nbsp;order costs and inventory carrying costs are the 
least.&nbsp;The result is the most cost effective quantity to order. In purchasing 
this is known as the order quantity, in manufacturing it is known as the 
production lot size.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;"><font face="Arial">
<span style class="auto-style1">While EOQ may not apply to every inventory situation, most 
organizations will find it beneficial in at least some aspect of their 
operation. Anytime you have repetitive purchasing or planning of an item, EOQ 
should be considered. Obvious applications for EOQ are purchase-to-stock 
distributors and make-to-stock manufacturers, however, make-to-order 
manufacturers should also consider EOQ when they have multiple orders or release 
dates for the same items and when planning components and sub-assemblies. 
Repetitive buy maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) inventory is also a good 
application for EOQ. Though EOQ is generally recommended in operations where 
demand is relatively steady, items with demand variability such as seasonality 
can still use the model by going to shorter time periods for the EOQ 
calculation. Just make sure the usage and carrying costs are based on the same 
time period. </span></font></p>

<span class="auto-style1">Exaggerated order costs and carrying costs are 
common mistakes made in EOQ calculations. Using all costs associated with your 
purchasing and receiving departments to calculate order cost or using all costs 
associated with storage and material handling to calculate carrying cost will 
give you highly inflated costs resulting in inaccurate results from your EOQ 
calculation.&nbsp;Note of caution if you are using benchmarks or published industry 
standards in calculations - the average purchase order costs can be untruly 
high.&nbsp;True that some operations may have higher purchase costs, especially if 
they are frequently re-sourcing, re-quoting, and buying from overseas vendors. 
However if the operation is primarily involved with repetitive buying from 
domestic vendors </span><font face="Times New Roman"><span class="auto-style1">&#8212;

<span style class="auto-style1">Also known as purchase cost or set up cost,&nbsp;this is the sum of the

<span style>For <b style>purchased items,</b>&nbsp;these would include the cost to 
enter the purchase order and/or requisition, any approval steps, the cost to 
process the receipt, incoming inspection, invoice processing and vendor payment, 
and in some cases a portion of the inbound freight may also be included in order 
cost. It is important to understand that these are costs associated with the 
frequency of the orders and not the quantities ordered. For example, in your 
receiving department the time spent checking in the receipt, entering the 
receipt, and doing any other related paperwork would be included, while the time 
spent repacking materials, unloading trucks, and delivery to other departments 
would likely not be included. If you have inbound quality inspection where you 
inspect a percentage of the quantity received you would include the time to get 
the specs and process the paperwork and not include time spent actually 
inspecting, however if you inspect a fixed quantity per receipt you would then 
include the entire time including inspecting, repacking, etc. In the purchasing 
department you would include all time associated with creating the purchase 
order, approval steps, contacting the vendor, expediting, and reviewing order 
reports, you would not include time spent reviewing forecasts, sourcing, getting 
quotes (unless you get quotes each time you order), and setting up new items. 
All time spent dealing with vendor invoices would be included in order cost.

<span style class="auto-style1">Associating actual costs to the activities associated with order 
cost is where many an EOQ formula runs afoul. Do not make a list of all of the 
activities and then ask the people performing the activities &quot;how long does it 
take you to do this?&quot;&nbsp;The results of this type of measurement are rarely even 
close to accurate. I have found it to be more effective to determine the 
percentage of time within the department consumed performing the specific 
activities and multiplying this by the total labor costs for a certain time 
period (usually a month) and then dividing by the line items processed during 
that same period.</span></font></p>

<span style>It is extremely difficult to associate inbound freight costs with

freight cost has a significant effect on unit cost <u>and</u> its effect on unit

<span style>In <b style>manufacturing,</b> the order cost would include the time 
to initiate the work order, time associated with picking and issuing components 
excluding time associated with counting and handling specific quantities, all 
production scheduling time, machine set up time, and inspection time. Production 
scrap directly associated with the machine setup should also be included in 
order cost as would be any tooling that is discarded after each production 
run.&nbsp;There may be times when you want to artificially inflate or deflate set-up 
costs. If you lack the capacity to meet the production schedule using the EOQ, 
you may want to artificially increase set-up costs to increase lot sizes and 
reduce overall set up time. If you have excess capacity you may want to 
artificially decrease set up costs, this will increase overall set up time and 
reduce inventory investment.&nbsp;The idea being that if you are paying for the labor 
and machine overhead anyway it would make sense to take advantage of the savings 
in reduced inventories.</span></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;">C<font face="Arial"><span style class="auto-style1">arrying 
cost (also called Holding cost), is the cost associated with having inventory on 
hand. It is primarily made up of the costs associated with the inventory 
investment and storage cost. For the purpose of the EOQ calculation, if the cost 
does not change based upon the quantity of inventory on hand it should not be 
included in carrying cost. In the EOQ formula, carrying cost is represented as 
the annual cost per average on hand inventory unit. Below are the primary 
components of carrying cost.</span></font></p>

inventory, the interest rate would be part of the carrying cost.&nbsp;If you did not 
borrow on the inventory, but have loans on other capital items, you can use the 
interest rate on those loans since a reduction in inventory would free up money 
that could be used to pay these loans.</span></span></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;"><font size="2" face="Arial">
<span style><b style><span class="auto-style2">Storage Costs</span></b><span class="auto-style1">. Mistakes in calculating storage costs 
are common in EOQ implementations. Generally companies take all costs associated 
with the warehouse and divide it by the average inventory to determine a storage 
cost percentage for the EOQ calculation. This tends to include costs that are 
not directly affected by the inventory levels and does not compensate for 
storage characteristics. Carrying costs for the purpose of the EOQ calculation 
should only include costs that are variable based upon inventory levels. </span> </span>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;"><font face="Arial">
<span style class="auto-style1">If you are running a packing operation where you have fixed picking 
locations assigned to each item where the locations are sized for picking 
efficiency and are not designed to hold the entire inventory, this portion of 
the warehouse should not be included in carrying cost since changes to inventory 
levels do not effect costs here. Your overflow storage areas would be included 
in carrying cost. Operations that use purely random storage for their product 
would include the entire storage area in the calculation. Areas such as 
shipping/receiving and staging areas are usually not included in the storage 
calculations. However. if you have to add an additional warehouse just for 
overflow inventory then you would include all areas of the second warehouse as 
well as freight and labor costs associated with moving the material between the 
warehouses.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;">
<font size="2" face="Arial" class="auto-style1">
<span style>Since storage costs are generally applied as a percentage of the 
inventory value you may need to classify your inventory based upon a ratio of 
storage space requirements to value in order to assess storage costs accurately. 
For example, annual storage costs are 5% of the average inventory value of
</span><span>$10,000</span><span style>, equal to $500. The EOQ formula apply a 
$500 storage cost to the average quantity of each of the category A items even 
though they actually took up only 1 pallet-size while the others take up 30 
pallets space. Categorizing these items would place category items A with 
minimal storage costs (say 3% or less) and the other categorized items with 
higher storage costs (4-10%, 11-20%, etc). This would then allow the EOQ formula 
to work correctly. </span></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;"><font face="Arial">
<span style class="auto-style1">There are situations where you may not want to include any storage 
costs in your EOQ calculation. If your operation has excess storage space of 
which it has no other uses you may decide not to include storage costs since 
reducing your inventory does not provide any actual savings in storage costs. As 
your operation grows near a point at which you would need to expand your 
physical operations you may then start including storage in the calculation.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;"><font face="Arial">
<span style class="auto-style1">A portion of the time spent on cycle counting should also be 
included in carrying cost, remember to apply costs which change based upon 
changes to the average inventory level. So with cycle counting, you would 
include the time spent physically counting and not the time spent filling out 
paperwork, data entry, and travel time between locations.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;"><font face="Arial">
<span style class="auto-style1">Other costs that can be included in carrying cost are risk 
factors&nbsp;associated with obsolescence, damage, and theft. Do not factor in these 
costs unless they are a direct result of the inventory levels and are 
significant enough to change the results of the EOQ equation.</span></font></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">
	<font face="Arial">
	Quantity discount logic can be programmed to work in conjunction with the

	<font face="Arial">
	Additional logic can be programmed to determine max quantities for items

	<font face="Arial">
	When used in manufacturing to determine lot sizes where production runs are 
	very long (weeks or months) and finished product is being released to stock

	the average inventory level.</font></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;"><font face="Arial">

<font size="4" color="#0000ff">Implementing EOQ</font></b></font></p>
<p class="auto-style3">
<font face="Arial"><br>There are 
primarily two ways to implement EOQ. Both methods obviously require that you 
have already determined the associated costs.<span style> </span>The simplest 
method is to set up your calculation in a spreadsheet program, manually 
calculate EOQ one item at a time, and then manually enter the order quantity 
into your inventory system.<span style> </span>If your inventory has fairly 
steady demand and costs and you have less than one or two thousand SKUs you can 
probably get by using this method once per year.<span style> </span>If you have 
more than a couple thousand SKUs and/or higher variability in demand and costs 
you will need to program the EOQ formula into your existing inventory system.<span style>
</span>This allows you to quickly re-calculate EOQ automatically as often as 
needed.<span style> </span>You can also use a hybrid of the two systems by 
downloading your data to a spreadsheet or database program, perform the 
calculations and then update your inventory system either manually or through a 
batch program.<span style> </span>Whichever method you use you should make sure 
to follow the following steps:<br></font></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">
	<font face="Arial">
	Test the formula. Prior to final implementation you must test the 
	programming and setup. Run the EOQ program and then manually check the 
	results using sample items that are representative of the variations of your 
	inventory base.</font></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">
	<font face="Arial">
	Project results. You'll need to run a simulation or use a representative 
	sampling of items to determine the overall short-term and long-term effects 
	the EOQ calculation will have on warehouse space, cash flow, and operations. 
	Dramatic increases in inventory levels may not be immediately feasible, if 
	this is the case you may temporarily adjust the formula until arrangements 
	can be made to handle the additional storage requirements and compensate for 
	the effects on cash flow. If the projection shows inventory levels dropping 
	and order frequency increasing, you may need to evaluate staffing, 
	equipment, and process changes to handle the increased activity.</font></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3px;" class="auto-style1">
	<font face="Arial">
	Maintain EOQ. The values for Order cost and Carrying cost should be 
	evaluated at least once per year taking into account any changes in interest 
	rates, storage costs, and operational costs.</font></li>
