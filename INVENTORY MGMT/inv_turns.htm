of Inventory Turnover</span></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">
Inventory Turnover or &quot;Turn&quot; in short, is one of the critical pieces of the 
business metric that serve many purposes - measuring inventory productivity, 
evaluating operational efficiencies, driving inventory reduction and therefore 
freeing up cashflow for investment in other business opportunities. High 
inventory levels are unhealthy because they represent an investment with a low 
or zero return of investment (ROI). It also opens the company up to trouble 
should sales demand and material prices continue to fall.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">
Inventory Turns is a ratio showing how many times a company's inventory is sold 
and replaced over a period. Let me give you a simple illustration as shown in 
the table below. Considering the three options all have a fixed annual cost of 
goods sold. If you bought $100,000 worth of products at one time and sold all at 
the end of the year for a profit, you had only turnaround your inventory once in 
a year. In the second option you first bought $50,000 worth of products by 
implementing a Reorder trigger stock replenishment strategy so that 
replenishment would happen just before your inventories dip into safety stock 
level. The subsequent $50,000 replenishment investment you were able to finance 
from the revenue you received from selling the first $50,000 worth of products. 
You sold everything at end of the year and you were able to turnaround your 
inventory investment with only half of the amount of COGS. In the third option 
supplier was able to reduce lead time from 6 months to 3 months. You initially 
purchased $25,000 worth of products, and replenished your stock in every three 
months from the proceeds you received from selling the previous stock. When you 
later sold everything within a year, it means you were able to replace your 
inventory 4 times within a year, but with only a much lower capital outlay of 
$25,000, and that's it! The last option with a Turns ratio of 4 provides you a 
more profitable business result because you were able to achieve the same gross 
profit but with much smaller investment sum, and most of all, you can make use 
of your other $75,000 to be invested in other businesses.</span></font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">I want to point out a few important 
notes when you are applying the above Inventory Turns formula:</font></p>
<p>
		<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">1) Average inventory at cost 
		is usually calculated by averaging the ending inventories for the past 
		12 months. However, if inventory fluctuates greatly from month to month, 
		or even within months, it may be necessary to calculate the average 
		inventory using weekly or bi-weekly ending inventory values, or 
		calculating your total inventory value on the first and fifteenth of 
		every month, instead of using a 12-month averaging.</font></p>
<p>
		<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">2) The use of average 
		inventory is primarily to minimize seasonal factors. If you have an 
		insignificant season for the period, you can choose to use the average 
		inventory value. Sometimes people do use an average inventory figure in 
		the denominator in order to avoid sudden changes in the inventory level 
		that are likely to occur on any period-end date where inventories are 
		kept unusually low, for example, to meet some corporate inventory 
		targets when the month-end closing coincides with the quarterly closing 
		calendar.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">3) Inventory turnover is 
		stated as an annual turnover. However, the period being measured does 
		not necessarily have to be a 12 month period. In certain situations, 
		particularly for seasonal items, inventory turn may be measured for a 
		period of a few months, with the result being &#8220;annualized&#8221; for 
		comparison purposes. &quot;Annualize&quot; means taking the period-end inventory, 
		multiply by 12 months.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">4) Inventory turn is a dynamic 
metric. As sales (and thus, cost of goods sold) and inventory levels fluctuate 
so does inventory turn. It is not enough to measure inventory turn for each year 
or quarter. At a minimum, in order to properly utilize inventory turn as a tool 
it is necessary to measure it monthly on a rolling basis. When you measure it 
monthly, make sure that you are consistently taking inventory value on the same 
day of every month. Also, you have to be consistent in using the same cost basis 
(standard cost, average cost, last cost, or replacement cost) in calculating 
both the cost of goods sold and average inventory investment. Otherwise, you 
won't be sure whether you have made effective comparison from period to period.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">5) Inventory turnover is a 
		measure of inventory productivity, and you should include only cost of 
		goods sold from stock sales which are filled from warehouse inventory. 
		Non-stock items such as direct shipments from supplier to customer 
		should be excluded from the calculation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">6) COGS should also include those 
internal orders charging to departmental cost centers, or stock transferred to 
other branches whether it is for production, repairs or re-distributing to other 
depots.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Below is another 
Inventory Turns formula that is based on Net Sales for the period instead of 
using COGS. I have seen managers using this formula to evaluate the turnovers 
for a contractual list of parts stocked for some customers. However, the 
previous formula using COGS is preferred because in this formula sales are 
recorded at &quot;Market Value&quot;, whereas inventories are recorded at &quot;Cost&quot;. This 
formula is misleading and can not be used to effectively gauge the healthiness 
of your inventories, but at best, is only to measure the industry averages. A 
low ratio would means low turnover which implies poor sales, whereas a high 
ratio implies strong sales. Is it really strong sales? You have to think it 
twice because you are overstating the nominator value which is selling prices, 
but with your denominator's average inventory value are at costs. </font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">After understanding from the above 
attributes of inventory turns, you know that you may be able to expand the 
inventory turns formula to evaluate on the many important areas of your 
inventory. In deed you can use it to measure the turns of your specific 
customer's lists of parts where company had signed a contractual agreement to 
keep the stock for a specified period and renew contract thereafter; or measure 
the turns of the specific product lines; or you can use it to measure the 
productivity of inventory being kept in the different depots (then transfer the 
slow-moving stock items to other depot or DC where there are more volume 
consumption); or use it to measure the productivity of inventory being 
differentiated by material classes, based up &quot;80/20&quot; rule pareto analysis or 
some other ratio of your choice. See my other <a href="pareto.htm#turnsbymc">
<font color="#0066CC">example</font></a> 
of measuring inventory turns by the top 80% of the inventory total value, using 
pareto analysis and ABC material classification codes, with a target of 5.0 
Turns. Pareto analysis effectively shows you where the under-performing material 
classes are, so that planners can evaluate whether forecasted demand has been 
too aggressive or whether the safety stock level and re-order point are being 
set too high, and then take 
concrete action plans. The other end result is that you can also liquidate or 
eliminate overstocks of the non-performing inventory.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font style="font-family: Arial" size="5"><b>Problems with 
setting Target Inventory Turns</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">When reviewing your 
inventory plans, service levels agreement and setting inventory turns targets, 
there are some critical questions you must always continuously evaluate and 
making comparisons for. More often, I have seen managers continuously using the 
same turns targets for the same customer throughout the periods. They failed to 
evaluate on external economic factors like when customers are reducing corporate 
spending in certain quarters, which would credibly impact on the turns 
performance. You should never fail to answer these following questions before 
setting your inventory goals:</font></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">Is your Turns 
	target realistic? How do your planned inventories compare to last period&#8217;s 
	actual performance?</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">Were the last 
	period&#8217;s inventories too little, too much, or just about right?</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Were there 
	difference in the costing method or standard costs used in your current 
	inventories compared to last period's?</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Are there stock 
	items that have safety stock levels set excessively high because of global 
	constrain factors, longer supply lead times, product high failure rates and 
	other interim issues?</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Are there slow or 
	average-moving stock items that should not even have been stocked in this 
	period in the first place?</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Is the existing 
	guideline and method for reviewing and setting safety stock levels efficient 
	or too conservative in approach? </font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">Are there 
	opportunities in this period to reduce supplier lead times, which would 
	enable your inventories to be reduced compared to last period's?</font></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">Are customers 
	production plan or sales forecast likely to be softened in this quarter, 
	which would enable a reduction in your safety stocks investment? </font></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Are you able to 
	reduce some inventories by cutting back 3% or 4% in certain product lines, 
	in expensive material categories, in certain depots or distribution outlets 
	without negatively impacting sales volume in this period?</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Did you do a 
	simulation program by taking in all the mentioned factors as above, base 
	upon the best approximate sales forecast for the next period, to ascertain 
	the appropriate yet realistic inventory turn target?</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">There must be a sense 
of urgency about identifying slow moving and non-performing inventory as quickly 
as possible and taking measures necessary to liquidate it. Slow moving and 
non-performing inventory add little to the bottom lines, and tie up valuable 
cash that could be used for other important business purposes.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font style="font-family:Arial" size="5"><b>Some words of 
caution with Cost of Goods Sold </b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">The turnover ratio 
can be skewed by changes in the underlying costing methods used to allocate 
direct labor and especially overhead cost pools to the inventory. For example, 
if additional categories of costs are added to the overhead cost pool, then the 
allocation to inventory will increase, which will reduce the reported level of 
inventory turnover &#8211; even though the turnover level under the original 
calculation method has not changed at all. The problem can also arise if the 
method of allocating costs is changed; for example, it may be shifted from an 
allocation based on labor hours worked to one based on machine hours worked, 
which can alter the total amount of overhead costs assigned to inventory. The 
problem can also arise if the inventory valuation is based on standard costs, 
and the underlying standards are altered. In all three cases, the amount of 
inventory on hand has not changed, but the costing systems used have altered the 
reported level of inventory costs, which impacts the reported level of turnover 
ratio.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Arial">A separate issue is 
that the basic inventory turnover figure may not be sufficient evidence of 
exactly where an inventory overage problem may lie. Accordingly, you can 
subdivide the measurement, so that there are separate inventory value 
calculations for raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods in different 
product lines, and perhaps subdivide it further by storage locations or 
production factories. This approach allows for more precise management of 
inventory-related problems in cases where inventory turnover ratios have been 
consistently low and without success in improvement despite that different 
inventory control measures were being implemented.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font style="font-family:Arial" size="5"><b>Your next 
challenge</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">Lastly, here is a 
challenge for you. How do you combine Inventory Turns formula with your Customer 
Service Level Percentage monthly performance, differentiated by orders delivery 
according to the different customers' requirement, within 4 hours, &gt;4&lt;12 hours, 
&gt;12&lt;24 hours, &gt;24&lt;48 hours and so on? Try whether you can provide such hybrid 
performance analysis and work this out. I already have the answer. Write to me 
if you need help on this. I would be pleased to help.&nbsp; </font></p>
