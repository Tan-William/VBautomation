		Example of a Prioritization Matrix</font></b></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first table below shows you the 
		basic matrix structure and how weight is allocated to each criteria. The 
		second table below demonstrates a survey exercise done by the personnel 
		department to evaluate on overall employees' morale in a company. It 
		uses 100 weighting points between the three criteria. Scoring of 
		problems was done differently for each criterion, but then converted to 
		a percentage before multiplying by the weight. This scheme resulted in 
		final scores that were also percentage figures. Scoring of problems 
		against criteria was done as follows:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the criterion of 'We are able 
			to influence', the ability of the personnel department to effect a 
			real change was discussed, and 100 points distributed between 
			problems.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the criterion of 'Many people 
			have problem', the actual number of people mentioning this problem 
			in the survey was used and then converted to a percentage.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the criterion of 'Likely 
			survey improvement', the improvement in the survey score in these 
			areas if this problem was fully addressed was used and then 
			converted to a percentage.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The figure below shows the 
		Prioritization Matrix. Pay and work overload, as the highest scoring 
		motivational problems, were selected for carrying forward for further 
		investigation. As a result of consequent work in the project, the pay 
		structure for certain grades was revised and training on job scheduling 
		was introduced. In the following year, the survey improved in these 
		areas by 2 and 3 points, respectively.</font></p>
