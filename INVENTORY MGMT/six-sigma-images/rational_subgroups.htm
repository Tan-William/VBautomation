</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most control charts, including the X-bar and 
Individual-X charts, rely upon Rational Subgroups to estimate the short term 
variation in the process. This short-term variation is then used to predict the 
longer-term variation defined by the control limits. But what is a Rational 
Subgroup? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A Rational Subgroup is simply &quot;a sample in 
which all of the items are produced under conditions in which only random 
effects are responsible for the observed variation.&quot; [Nelson, Lloyd S. &quot;Control 
Charts: Rational Subgroups and Effective Applications,&quot; Journal of Quality 
Technology. Vol. 20, No. 1, January 1988). As such, it has the following 
properties. </font></p>
<ol>
	<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The observations comprising the subgroup 
	are <b>independent</b>. Two observations are independent if neither 
	observation influences, or results from, the other. When observations are 
	dependent on one another, we say the process has Autocorrelation, or Serial 
	Correlation. (These terms mean the same thing). Many processes are subject 
	to Autocorrelation. Examples include: </font>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chemical Processes: When dealing with 
		liquids, particularly in large baths, samples taken close together in 
		time are influenced by one another. The liquid retains the effect of the 
		first observation, such as temperature, which carries over into 
		subsequent temperature observations for a period of time. Subgroups 
		formed over a small time frame from these types of processes are 
		sometimes called <b>homogenous subgroups</b>, since the observations 
		within the subgroups are often nearly identical (except for the effect 
		of measurement variation). </font></li>
		<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Service Processes: Consider the wait 
		time at a bank. The wait time of any person in the line is influenced by 
		the wait time of the person in front of him/her. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Discrete part manufacturing: Although 
		this is the &quot;classic&quot; case of independent subgroups, when feedback 
		control is used to change a process based upon past observations, the 
		observations become inherently dependent. </font></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When observations within a subgroup are 
auto-correlated, the within subgroup variation is often quite small, and not a 
reflection of the between subgroup process variation. The small within subgroup 
variation forces the control limits to be too narrow, resulting in frequent out 
of control conditions. This leads to Tampering.</font></p>
<ol start="2">
	<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The observations within a subgroup are 
	from a single, stable process. If subgroups contain the elements of multiple 
	process streams, or if other special causes occur frequently within 
	subgroups, then the within subgroup variation will be large relative to the 
	variation between subgroup averages. This large within subgroup variation 
	forces the control limits to be too far apart, resulting in a lack of 
	sensitivity to process shifts. Run Test 7 (15 successive points within one 
	sigma of center line) is helpful in detecting this condition. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The subgroups are formed from observations 
	taken in a time-ordered sequence. In other words, subgroups cannot be 
	randomly formed from a set of data (or a box of parts); instead, the data 
	comprising a subgroup must be a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the process over a small 
	window of time, and the order of the subgroups would show how those 
	snapshots vary in time (like a &quot;movie&quot;). The size of the &quot;small window of 
	time&quot; is determined on an individual process basis to minimize the chance of 
	a special cause occurring in the subgroup. </font></li>
