CAPACITY PLANNING</font></b></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana"><span class="auto-style1">The main reason why Rough Cut Capacity Planning 
		(<b>RCCP</b>) is needed because </span> </font>
		<span class="auto-style1">Material Requirements Planning
		<font face="Verdana">system </font>(<b>MRP</b>)<font face="Verdana"> 
		assumes that needed capacity always is available. RCCP helps to identify 
		the key resources (material and personnel shortages, lead time 
		constraints, capacity issues, sole supplier, space, machineries, process 
		bottlenecks that limit output), and to test the feasibility of the 
		supply plan, production plan and master schedule before doing any 
		detailed capacity/material planning. It also helps to initiate action 
		for making mid- to long-term capacity adjustments. (Supply Plan can 
		include purchased parts whereas Production Plan is strictly for 
		production).</font></p>
		<p></span><font face="Verdana"><span class="auto-style1">In this section, I will show you the RCCP 
		technique using Resource Profile approach. I will not go through other 
		RCCP techniques like the Overall Factors (CPOF) and the Bill Of Labor 
		(BOL) approach, which are least detailed, implicitly assume a 
		Lot-For-Lot policy for setting lot sizes, and are also insensitive to 
		the shifts in product mix. They also do not take Lead-Time Offset into 
		account, but which the Resource Profile approach does. In any event, 
		rough-cut capacity plans should be used only to determine if sufficient 
		capacity exists over broad time frames such as a month or a quarter.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial"><br>
		</font>
		<font color="#FF6600" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>What is RCCP and how 
		does it work?</b></font><br>
		<br><span class="auto-style1">Rough Cut Capacity Planning (RCCP) is a rough check to evaluate all the 
		key resources, to test the validity of MPS, to determine the feasibility 
		of fulfilling the approved Production Plan that was developed in the 
		Sales &amp; Operations Planning process. Once the master scheduler 
		determines that a realistic plan exists, the production plan is then 
		load into MRP to drive the allocation for all the lower-level materials. 
		The production plan now translates into discrete part numbers, 
		quantities and due dates. Because MRP is capacity-insensitive; it 
		implicitly assumes that sufficient capacity is available to produce 
		components at the time they're needed, and to avoid being caught by 
		surprises, RCCP is necessary.</p>
		<p>A problem commonly encountered in operating MRP systems is the 
		existence of an Overstated MPS. An overstated master production schedule 
		is one that orders more production to be released than production can 
		complete. An overstated MPS causes raw materials and WIP inventories to 
		increase because more materials are purchased and released to the 
		production floor than they can be completed and shipped before due 
		dates. It also causes a buildup of job queues on the shop floor. Since 
		jobs have to wait to be processed, actual lead times increase, causing 
		ship dates to be missed. As lead times increase, forecast accuracy over 
		the lead-time diminishes because forecasts are more accurate for shorter 
		periods than for longer ones. Thus, an overstated master schedule leads 
		to past-due orders and other problems. Validating the MPS with respect 
		to capacity is an extremely important step in MRP, and is called Rough 
		Cut Capacity Planning. There is no hard and fast rule on the level of 
		detail that should be incorporated in the MPS validation. Some companies 
		used very crude techniques, other used detailed, time-phased, methods.</span></p>
		<p><br><b><font color="#FF6600" style="font-size: 16pt">The Role of RCCP 
		in Production Planning &amp; Control</font></b><br><br><font color="#0000FF">
		<a target="_blank" href="images/mrp.html"><span class="auto-style1">Figure 1</span></a></font><span class="auto-style1"> 
		shows an overview of the entire production planning and control (<b>PPC</b>) 
		process under MRP. Capacity management techniques usually are separated 
		into four categories that represent the four time horizons --&nbsp; 
		Manufacturing Resource Planning (<b>MRP II</b>), Aggregate Production 
		Planning, Rough Cut Capacity Planning (RCCP), and Capacity Requirements&nbsp; 
		Planning (<b>CRP</b>). In any MRP system, the same sequence is to create 
		a master schedule, use Rough Cut Capacity Planning to verify that the 
		MPS is feasible, perform the MRP explosion, and send the Planned Order 
		Release data to Capacity Requirements Planning. The following describes 
		the role RCCP plays in the overall PPC system:</p>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>To develop an achievable Master Production Schedule.</li>
			<li>T o plan and control <b>priorities and capacities</b>.</li>
			<li><b>Priority Planning</b> is the process of specifying batch 
			quantities and their start and finish dates for all Supply Orders 
			where procurement and manufacturing are involved.</li>
			<li><b>Priority Control</b> is making the right things at the right 
			time. It is completely dependent on maintaining a balance between 
			MPS requirements and factory Output rates, in which suppliers 
			delivery performance is vital.</li>
			<li><b>Capacity planning</b> is the task of determining how much 
			output is needed from factory and from suppliers.</li>
			<li><b>Capacity control</b> is the comparison between planned levels 
			and actual outputs achieved, and the identification of significant 
			variances above or below plan. Corrective action must be done 
			quickly (adjust capacity or changing the master schedule).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In MRP system, the functions of capacity planning and control are 
		separated from the functions of priority planning and control. Priority 
		planning is the task of the MRP system. Priority control is determined, 
		for instance, on the shop floor by the use of a dispatching technique to 
		sequence specific tasks on specific machines.</p>
		<p>A few reasons I can think of why RCCP techniques are not used in some 
		companies are: (1) data requirements are quite high - firm demand, 
		forecasts, past data, lead times, utilization, products and process 
		knowledge. (2) they don't have a stable MPS. If forecast and firm orders 
		keep changing within week, and people bypassing agreed DTF and&nbsp; 
		Planning Time Fence, capacity planning is a futile exercise. (3) they 
		don't have the right skill, it is very time-consuming, or they are doing 
		it the wrong ways.</p>
		<p>All companies running MRP should implement capacity planning. 
		Companies that have unstable master schedules can also be due to 
		inadequate Safety Stock at the MPS level (besides orders and forecasts 
		push in and push out, human errors, etc). The inadequate safety stock 
		can be due to a poor demand forecasting or failure to measure Forecast 
		Error. In turn, safety-stock level can provide protection against 
		forecast error. For capacity planning process to be effective, we must 
		make sure that there is adequate safety stock level, improving forecast 
		error, and a stable master schedule (as I said, frequent last minute 
		schedule changes are very expensive).</span></p>

		actually tie up that resource. This is different from <b>Queuing time</b>,
		<b>Waiting time</b>, and <b>Move time</b> which impact the time it takes

		expedite in small batches, thereby cutting down the times in queue, wait 
		and moving the parts between work centers.</span></p>

		<span class="auto-style1">You should use

		<a target="_blank" href="../EXCEL/excel_worksheet_functions.htm#sumproduct">
		<font color="#0000FF">SUMPRODUCT</font></a> formula) instead of a 
		regular Average standard time when creating resource profile. For 
		example, standard time for a key resource should be the sumproduct of 
		total setup time + run time (from Figure 16.5 Routing file) and the sum 
		of production output for an individual product family, divide by sum of 
		production output for that individual product family. You can either use 
		historical output for each work centers or using MPS volume. Use the 
		same way to calculate standard time for the rest of the key resources. 
		If engineering team has regularly updated process routings, setup times 
		and run times, using this method can be quite accurate in developing the 
		predictive resources profile. Once you are done,&nbsp; you should have a 
		Resource Profile something like in Figure 16.3. You also note that Final 
		Assembly Line 2 does not run product family C, and also supplier XYZ 
		doesn't supply material for product family B.</p>

		<p><br>
		<img border="0" src="images/rccp_fig16.6.gif" width="488" height="213"></p>
		<p><span class="auto-style1">We also need to determine <b>Lead-Time Offset</b>, which is the time 
		between the need for the resource and the date that the product has been 
		promised. Lead-Time Offset is necessary if a product has longer lead 
		times. Figure 16.6 illustrates a time line of the resources identified 
		through the process routing for the critical Base Assembly. It shows 
		that the longest lead time needed for the base assembly is 28.45 days, 
		so the lead-time offset for this resource is about 29 hours prior to the 
		completion of the lamp assembly. Every resource has its lead-time 
		offset, but practically if the offset is less than 30days, you don't 
		need to consider it when evaluating the validity of the production plan. 
		In this case, even if you rough-cut master schedule and plan production 
		on weekly basis, 29 hours is well within one week.</p>
		<p>Now, with the key resources profile ready at hand, Johor Lamps want 
		to validate the master schedule for the next 6 months, to verify whether 
		there is adequate capacity at all key resources to meet the production 
		plan (Figure 16.7). Of course, assuming there's a stable MPS. The 
		technique involves comparing a machine-load report of required capacity 
		to planned-available capacity at each work center. Here we need to 
		understand there are several types of capacities being used.</span></p>
		<p><font size="4" color="#800000" face="Arial"><b>Demonstrated Capacity</b></font><br>
		<span class="auto-style1">This is the proven or historical capacity of a key resource or work 
		center. Demonstrated capacity could potentially change if resources are 
		added or if operations are altered. In such case, adjustments to planned 
		capacity must be considered before making evaluation of the production 
		plan.</span></p>
		<p><b><font size="4" color="#800000" face="Arial">Planned Capacity</font></b><br>
		<span class="auto-style1">This is demonstrated capacity plus or minus anticipated changes or 
		adjustments to the product-flow process. For example, a production line 
		has a regular demonstrated capacity of 400 units/month, an upward 
		adjustment to 450 beginning sometime in the next few months might be 
		reasonable if additional operators or equipment is expected to be 
		available.</span></p>
		<p><b><font size="4" color="#800000" face="Arial">Maximum Capacity</font></b><br>
		<span class="auto-style1">This is the maximum load a resource can handle under any reasonable set 
		of circumstances. This can be achieved through several means: use of 
		available overtime, adding shifts, staff additions, offload volume to 
		outside vendors, pay extra for supply priorities, paying premium 
		freights to expedite materials delivery, etc).</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><font style="font-size: 16pt" color="#FF6600">Determining Capacity 
		Available or Planned Capacity</font></b><br>
		<br><span class="auto-style1">Since Johor's works 3 eight-hour shifts each day and there are 21 
		working days in Sept, it might seem that the capacity available to, for 
		example the Copper-Plating department, is 518 hours per month (24 
		hours/day/equipment less 1.75 hours of change-shift-rest time/day, times 
		21 days in Sept). However, there should be an adjustment between the 
		standard time and the actual average production rate of that department. 
		The first adjustment factor is known as Utilization. <b>Utilization</b> 
		is a number between 0 and 1 which is equal to 1 minus the proportion of 
		time typically lost due to machine breakdown, labor shortage, parts 
		failure, or material unavailability. The second adjustment factor is 
		known as Efficiency. <b>Efficiency</b> is defined as the average of 
		standard hours of actual production (after minus the unavoidable lost 
		time - setup time, change shift, rest time). If a time standard is 
		exactly right, efficiency is 1. If the time actually required to perform 
		the work is less than the standard, efficiency is more than 1. If the 
		time actually required to perform the work is more than the standard 
		time, efficiency is less than 1. See another
		<a target="_blank" href="capacity_requirements_planning.htm#measuring_capacity">
		<font color="#0000FF">example on Utilization and Efficiency</font></a>.</p>
		<p>Capacity available is determined by multiplying time available x

		<p align="left"><b><font size="5" color="#FF6600">The Resource Profile 
		Technique</font></b>
		<p align="left"><br><span class="auto-style1">This technique is designed to <u>convert the master 
		production schedule from units of end items to be produced into the 
		amount of time required on the key resources</u>. Resource Profile 
		approach considers lead-time offsets. Unlike other techniques, <u>it 
		does not assume all components are built in the same time period as the 
		end item</u>; it time-phases the labor and lead time requirements. In 
		some instances, RCCP may reveal that key resources are presently 
		inadequate and that expanding the resources requires more time or more 
		equipments than the company is willing to invest. In these instances, 
		the MPS must be revised. Resource Profile technique is the most detailed 
		rough-cut approach, but is not as detailed as Capacity Requirements 
		Planning.<p>Resource Profile technique uses detailed data on the time 
		standards for each product at the key resources. A <b>Time Standard</b> 
		is the time it should take an average worker working at a normal pace to 
		produce one unit of an item. The time standard for any part has built 
		into it an allowance for rest to overcome fatigue or unavoidable delays, 
		etc. Because production processes are&nbsp; continually improved, time 
		standards become less reliable unless they are being updated. For this 
		reason, you should not use time standard that is two or three years old 
		to perform capacity study. However, poor standards are not an absolute 
		barrier to capacity planning; you can use an adjustment factor known as 
		&#8220;<b>efficiency</b>&#8221; to correct for outdated time standards (although 
		efficiency is not intended to reduce the need to keep time standards 
		updated). The detailed Resource Profile approach also requires standard 
		times data, and additionally, lead times required to perform certain 
		tasks.</p>
		<p>The results of RCCP using the Resource Profile approach for Johor 
		Lamps can be developed as this example shown in Figure 16.7 below. The 
		computations are in the worksheet available for
		<a href="inventory%20supp/rccp_required_vs_planned.xls">
		<font color="#0000FF">download</font></a>. At one glance in Figure 16.7, 
		you can see that there are Overloads at Chemical Dip and also for 
		supplier XYZ in the same month of Nov, Dec and Jan. The Required 
		Capacity in the these 3 months exceed the Planned Capacity as indicated 
		by the negative Net Variance (in red fonts). The same situation happens 
		for supplier XYZ. The projected Underloads are especially serious 
		throughout the six months in Copper-Plating, Final Assembly Line 1 &amp; 2, 
		ranging from 40% to 78%. If you look at the total % variance for these 
		three key resources, there are projected schedule overloads of 47% in 
		Copper-Plating facility, 61% in Final Assy Line 1, and 70% in Final Assy 
		Line 2.</p>
		<p>Note that the Planned Capacity has already included the Maximum 10% 
		overtime that is permitted.</span></p>

		<br><br>

		<p><span class="auto-style1">Now, what can you do about the rest of production planning after 
		reviewing the results from this rough-cut capacity analysis over the 6 
		months period? Well, before making any changes or take actions, you need 
		to do another rough-cut analysis, this time at the master schedule 
		level. Companies that have varied mixes of products are especially 
		compelled to do this. RCCP at the master schedule level use the same 
		logic as rough cut at the production plan level, only difference is the 
		calculations are extended down one or two additional levels. The master 
		schedule is &quot;exploded&quot; through the Resource Profile to generate the 
		required capacity to meet the master plan. </p>
		<p>Let's look at one month, Nov, to analyze projected capacities on a 
		weekly basis, at the Overload resource - Chemical Dip. Figure 16.8 shows 
		the quantities scheduled for each master schedule item. Note that the 
		totals are the same as in Figure 16.4 Nov's totals, but clearly this 
		2nd-phase MPS rough-cut yields more detailed information, since it is at 
		the component items level. The difference here is that the product 
		families volume are broken down into component totals for the month, and 
		analyzed on a week-by-week basis. To do this, take the quantities for 
		each master scheduled item, multiply by the time requirements in the 
		resource profile. (you need a
		<a target="_blank" href="../EXCEL/excel_worksheet_functions.htm#sumproduct">
		<font color="#0000FF">SUMPRODUCT</font></a> formula). All formula are in 
		the worksheet for
		<a href="inventory%20supp/rccp_by_MPS_ComponentItems.xls">
		<font color="#0000FF">download</font></a>. These component items are 
		from the forecast, firm planned orders, and booked orders.</span></p>

		<span class="auto-style1">Before we proceed further, we may want to set some guidelines pertaining 
		to the % variance in Figure 16.8. It would seems logical to accept that

		</span>
		<font face="Arial"><span class="auto-style1">&#9679;&nbsp; </span> </font>
		<span class="auto-style1">no more than 10%

		<span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;more than 20% greater than the 
		planned capacity, the master schedule is considered unrealistic.<br>
		</span>
		<font face="Arial"><span class="auto-style1">&#9679; </span> </font>
		<span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;between 10% and 20% greater than 
		the planned capacity, the master schedule is questionable. Need to find 
		out more information about the resource; ask the staff who have worked 
		long enough in that resource department, you will be surprised they can 
		give you a lot more accurate information.</p>
		<p>Of course, in other industries and different environments, these 
		guidelines may need tighter tolerances, say, 5% to 10%. Implement 
		necessarily as you can deem fit.</p>
		<p>For November, week 43, 44 &amp; 45 in Figure 16.8 have revealed serious 
		overloads even though the planned capacity has already included the max 
		10% overtime allowed. What causes it and what can be done? It might be 
		possible to assign the workers from Final Assembly 2 Lines where 
		underloads are projected, to help in the Chemical Dip department for the 
		first 4 weeks in Nov. Splitting lots might helps to reduce some waiting 
		time. It also might be possible to shift some of the volume from Nov 1st 
		week to Oct where there is a little excess capacity. Of course, any 
		decision of moving in or shifting out a master scheduled item requires 
		consideration of the impact of that move on the ability to meet the 
		customer promise dates. As a last resort, you can either tap into the 
		maximum capacity which has included the 4 weekends, or sub-contracting 
		out some of the load to approved vendors. Using the same calculations 
		and analysis, you can extend to cover the rest of the key resources to 
		have detailed view of all the MPS items and take appropriate corrective 
		actions.</p>
		<p>In many of today's ERP systems, there is also a &quot;What-If&quot; scenarios 
		analysis capability being built into the capacity planning module, that 
		makes it possible for the scheduler to juggle the numbers - shifting 
		workers, reschedule in and -out, alternate routings, splitting lots, add 
		equipments, off-loading to vendors, overtime, hiring temporary workers 
		and so on. </span> </p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size: 16pt"><font color="#FF6600">Revising the 
		Master Schedule</font></span></b><br>
		<br><span class="auto-style1">Most companies consider a revision to the MPS to be a solution of last 
		resort in the event of insufficient capacity, and to be implemented only 
		when all other options are exhausted. Actually this is not entirely true 
		and logical. A number of things can cause an order to be expedited. An 
		order is rarely de-expedited. There may be several orders on the 
		existing master schedule that no longer are needed as early as the 
		current due date shows them to be needed. It is not uncommon to find a 
		machine-load capacity planning report that shows too much work in the 
		first two or three periods, but ample capacity beyond that. This problem 
		may be corrected or alleviated merely by people honestly putting the 
		&quot;true&quot; need date on all orders.</p>
		<p>If de-expediting, overtime, subcontracting, alternate routing, and 
		shifting personnel collectively cannot provide sufficient capacity, MPS 
		revision does in fact become the technique of last resort, It is 
		important to understand that when an unavoidable capacity overload 
		exists, it must be corrected. If insufficient capacity exists, it is 
		impossible to complete all orders on time. The choice now is to have 
		management decide whose order will be late based on the impact on the 
		whole business. </span> </p>
