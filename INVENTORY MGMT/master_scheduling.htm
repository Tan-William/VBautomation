		do need Master Scheduling?</b></font><font size="5"><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
		<br><span class="auto-style3">Master Schedule is a set of planning numbers that drives the MRP. It 
		represents build plan that includes all the individual product families, 
		expressed in specific configurations, quantities and dates. It takes 
		into account the forecast, SO&amp;P's aggregate production plan, customer 
		orders, projected available balances, Available-To-Promise, backlog, 
		availability of material, the planned and maximum capacity, management 
		policies and goals. We need master scheduling to plan and commit 
		resources to meet customer demands, guiding against excess inventories 
		and backlog. Basically it is balancing supply and demand by discrete 
		time segments - daily and weekly. Most importantly, Master Scheduling 
		ensures integration and implementation of the sales, manufacturing, 
		finance, engineering, procurement, and logistics plans, that would 
		promise product deliveries and continual profitability of the company's 
		business.&nbsp; </span> </p>
		<p align="left"><span class="auto-style3">Because actual demand does fluctuate from period to 
		period, production can not always run at constant rates. So instead of 
		being a constant maximizer on customer service level and plant 
		utilization, and a minimizer on inventory and all the associated costs, 
		a master scheduler will be coordinating and optimizing all the internal 
		and external resources, in order to balance the conflicting situations 
		in demand and supply. But how exactly does the master scheduler smooth 
		out the peaks and valleys of demand while keeping the master schedule in 
		balance? Below are some choices:</p>
		<p align="left">&#9632; Use of <a target="_blank" href="SS.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">Safety Stock Level</font></a>,
		<a target="_blank" href="rop.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Re-Order Point</font></a> 
		and Lot-Sizing strategies.<br>
		&#9632; Use of overtime, offloading work by subcontracting out or in-sourcing, 
		adding or cutting down shift, personnel or equipment.<br>
		&#9632; Offer price breaks for customers willing to delay deliveries due to 
		our cumulating past-due orders.<br>
		&#9632; Varying the lead times when quoting delivery dates to customers, in 
		order to prioritize orders.</span></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#FF6600"><b><br>
		Examples of a Poor Master Scheduling<br>
		<br>
		</b></font><span class="auto-style3">The telltale signs of a badly coordinated master scheduling 
		are such as:<br>
		&#8211; frequent schedule changes causing disruptions on the shop 
		floor<br>
		&#8211; unplanned overtime and late off-loading to outside processing<br>
		&#8211; 
		over- or under-utilized resources<br>
		&#8211; lack of capacity study (at least to 
		Rough Cut production plan and master schedule)<br>
		&#8211; high Work-In-Process<br>
		&#8211; long queues of late-start work orders<br>
		&#8211; late issue of purchase 
		orders<br>
		&#8211; late release of work orders<br>
		&#8211; missed material delivery due dates 
		from suppliers<br>
		&#8211; missed shipment dates<br>
		&#8211; increasing past due orders<br>
		&#8211; 
		misdirected efforts from use of hot list or constraint parts list (used 
		as a priority setting mechanism due to frequent part shortages from both 
		manufacturing and suppliers)<br>
		&#8211; demand forecast errors that build either 
		too much or too little<br>
		&#8211; inaccurate bills-of-material and inventories record inaccuracies<br>
		&#8211; end-of-month scrambling to meet shipment targets, and so on.</span></p>

		<b>Dangers of an Overloaded Master Schedule and the solution</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
		<br><span class="auto-style3">Companies that always carry past-due orders into the next period not 
		only will create a past-due MPS, but also overloading master schedules 
		that in turn create many other problems. Examples such as critical 
		material stockout, partially built products forced to take offline, 
		de-kitting in order to reschedule orders, high WIP, missing critical shipment dates, price concessions to angry customers, 
		costs go up due to overtime, expedited material purchases and air 
		freight, budgets blow up, stressed-out buyers and planners working 
		overtime to coordinate the overloaded materials and production 
		scheduling, etc - all continue to plague the companies, which now have 
		an uphill task to catch up.</span></p>
		<p align="left"><span class="auto-style3">Why do we allow the master schedule to be overloaded? 
		Very often, the cause and answer come down to work behaviors where close 
		coordination, team work and trust are absent. If Production is always 
		late or run short, or stockroom always has not enough in-stock qty to 
		fulfill an order, Sales and Account teams will have tendency to inflate 
		the forecast volume, or move the orders up in the schedule 
		(the later causes some promised orders to be pushed out due to another 
		product being rescheduled into their committed time slots). It is a 
		natural response that explains why they deliberately overloading the 
		schedule - to ensure enough units will be built and be made available 
		earlier. When actual orders 
		don't happen, scheduler and planners will learn the game and begin 
		discounting orders as they appear. Avoidance and denial of the problems 
		in this atmosphere of distrust, becomes the course of least resistance. 
		Often, the attitude is: &quot;sweep it under the carpet&quot;, park it at someone 
		else's &quot;door&quot;, or park at no man's &quot;land&quot;.</p>
		<p align="left">The manager needs to make people admit to their problems 
		and past mistakes, and make them agree to a list of operating guideline. 
		Then, the next step toward dealing with an overloaded master schedule is 
		a top-down analysis of the following:</p>
		<p align="left">&#9632; List down the action priorities from Sales (eg. 
		incorrect SO dates), Planning (eg. incorrect item in Production Order), Purchasing 
		(eg. past due delivery dates) and Production 
		(eg. undeclared scraps or wrong unit consumption rate), along with&nbsp;
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; owner names and expected dates of completion.<br>
		&#9632; To reschedule priority Purchase Orders with suppliers and outside 
		process vendors, making sure no &quot;disconnecting&quot; dates between 
		each manufacturing process.<br>
		&#9632; To reschedule allocation of production resources to most aging 
		or most important customer orders.<br>
		&#9632; To reschedule production with completion dates that are realistic.<br>
		&#9632; Stop taking new order into a recovery time slot, but promise a date 
		where all Past Due's are scheduled to clear.<br>
		&#9632; Avoid accepting new orders at short lead time that would increase the 
		chance of missing other orders (use ATP and realistic lead times).<br>
		&#9632; Establish a strategy and plan of how to get out of the over-scheduled 
		situation (overtime, outsourcing, adding shift and equipment, etc), 
		monitor and measure its success.</p>
		<p align="left">As you can see, guarding against an overloaded master 
		schedule, is never easy but requires close coordination with all the 
		other functions of the company, in order to get the demand and supply 
		back into balance.</span></p>

      	<font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#FF6600"><b>The relationship of MPS 
		to RCCP and MRP</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
		<br>
		<span class="auto-style3">To understand where exactly master scheduling fits in, see <a target="_blank" href="mrp.htm#MRP_Figure8.1">
		<font color="#0000FF">Figure 8.1</font></a> on the MRP page.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="auto-style3">The master scheduler has to create a detailed plan in terms of 
individual product configurations, quantities and required dates, in order to 
meet the demand requirements mapped out in the aggregate production plan, 
developed during the Sales and Operations Planning Process (SOP). In developing that 
schedule, a capacity study must be made. Most companies use only the
<a target="_blank" href="rough_cut_capacity_planning.htm"><font color="#0000FF">
Rough Cut Capacity Planning</font></a> (RCCP) to do this, which is a sanity 
check on the feasibility of the MPS against planned quantities and dates, 
availability of equipments, shifts, labor hours, cumulative lead times and other 
key resources. The objective is to identify any potential bottleneck operations 
that may disrupt the master schedule. If the master schedule is not feasible at 
this stage, it should be adjusted. Any serious capacity problems identified 
should be relayed back to the aggregate production plan to reconcile. </p>
<p align="left">Once a feasible <b>Master Production Schedule</b> (MPS) is 
confirmed, the numbers are input into the ERP system; then the master scheduled 
items are &quot;exploded&quot; through <a target="_blank" href="mrp.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">Material Requirement Planning</font></a> (MRP) using 
bills-of-material, to determine the gross requirements for all the lower-level 
items to support the MPS scheduled receipt. The output are the MRP's Computer 
Planned Orders (<b>CPO</b>) for master scheduler/planners and Purchase 
Requisitions for buyers to act upon. Combining the close coordination of master 
scheduling, capacity planning, suppliers scheduling and execution, will ensure 
that the required materials and capacity to produce the planned items are 
available at the right time and in the right quantities.</span></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#FF6600">How Master 
Scheduling works?<br>
<br>
</font></b><span class="auto-style3">To manage the imbalances in supply and demand in time segments 
necessitate the need for MPS matrix. The format of MPS matrix depends on the 
choice of ERP software that you have. Figure 15.2 below shows you just how the 
MPS and MRP matrices are linked in the ERP software. It also illustrates to you 
the integration of Safety Stock, Planning Time Fence (PTF), Demand Time Fence 
(DTF), how Action Exception Messages are created, rescheduling Time Zones, as 
well as all the components of demand and supply in the MPS and MRP matrices &#8213; 
Independent and Dependent Forecast, Actual and Total Demand, Projected Gross 
Requirements (PGR), Projected Available Balance (PAB), Available-To-Promise 
(ATP), MRP's or Computer Planned Order (CPO), Firm Planned Order (FPO), Planned 
Order Release (POR), and Scheduled Receipt (SR) which is often used 
interchangeably with the terms Released Order, Work Order, Production Order, Job 
Order, and Purchase Order (if it is a purchased item).</p>

activities before we go to understand the flow of master scheduling illustrated 
in Figure 15.2.</span></p>

		<b>Master Schedule (MPS)</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<span class="auto-style3">This is the row where supply orders (quantities and due dates) will be placed by 
the master scheduler and the MRP. Master Schedule supply orders consists of the 
MRP's Planned Order, Firm Planned Order, and Released Order (or Work Order).</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#0033CC">


		<b>Released Order (RO) or Scheduled Receipt (SR)</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<span class="auto-style3">Other aliases are Work Order, Manufacturing Order, Production Order, or</span></font><font face="Arial"><span class="auto-style3"> 
Purchase Order if it is a purchased item. Work Orders initiate the production 
process by authorizing material, labor, and equipment to be used to manufacture 
specific products. Released Orders are not exploded via MRP because they would 
double create lower-level allocations for materials, and would be treated 
similarly as the demand on the materials contained in the FPO's bill-of-material 
until that material is issued according to the build plan.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#0033CC"><b>Firmed Planned 
Orders (FPO)</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<span class="auto-style3">FPO is a supply order that the master scheduler places to take control away from 
MRP. It is a place-holder that allows the master scheduler to firm a computer's 
planned order in qty and time. ERP system is restricted from changing the FPO, 
but is the scheduler's responsibility to change it. Once the scheduler creates 
FPOs that balance supply to demand, MRP will not attempt to create additional 
supply orders because they won't be needed. FPOs with the bills-of-material are 
then exploded through MRP to plan materials and capacities.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><a name="CPO"></a><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#0033CC"><b>
Computer Planned Orders (CPO)</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<span class="auto-style3">CPO is a supply order created by MRP system, not by master scheduler. It serves 
as a suggestion telling that a Firm Planned Order of an indicated size would be 
needed if demand and supply are to balance. The scheduler must convert the CPO 
into Firm Planned Order, or convert directly into a Released Order. MRP bases 
its creation of CPOs on Demand Need Dates, Projected Gross Requirements, Safety 
Stock, On-Hand Balances, predetermined Lot Sizes, and Lead Times to ensure that 
the release and production or purchase of material will meet the demand need 
date. CPO creation rules are controlled by </span> <b><span class="auto-style3">Planning Time Fence</span></b>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#0033CC"><b>Planning Time 
Fence (PTF)</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<span class="auto-style3">It is a date-related boundary that allows MRP system to create CPOs with due 
dates after predefined dates, and not before. Within the planning time fence, 
the master scheduler take complete controls all the supply orders. By operating 
with in planning time fence, MRP system knows when it can or can not place a 
CPO.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#0033CC"><b>Projected 
Available Balance (PAB)</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<span class="auto-style3">It calculates what will be in inventory at a specific of time. If a company 
doesn't use Safety Stock, the perfect supply-demand balance will be a projected 
inventory balance of zero. That means a positive PAB for any period of time 
would suggest a potential surplus or excess stock condition. A negative PAB 
means the system is projecting a potential shortage. In the case of a potential 
surplus, MRP may recommend to move supply orders out, cancel some, or cancel all 
altogether. In the case of potential shortfall, MRP Exception Messages may ask 
to release new supply orders or move future supply orders in to cover the 
projected deficit. </span> </font></p>

in the same way as does the MPS system (see the next example down). The Planned 
Order Release row shows the equivalents of the Computer Planned Orders (<b>CPO</b>) 
that work in the MPS system. It is the row that MRP attempts to deal with any 
potential supply shortfalls that appear in the <b>PAB</b> row. For example, to 
avoid a PAB shortfall (-15) from developing in week 45, MRP will recommend a <b>
CPO</b> in week 45, and therefore it must be released in week 43 (because lead 
time for Control Box Sub-Assy is 2 weeks). The same for a CPO to be released in 
week 44 due to a PAB deficit in week week 46. After checking that there are no 
material and capacity issues, the scheduler/ planner will convert the <b>CPO</b> 
into a <b>Scheduled Receipt</b> (Released Order, Work Order or Production Order) 
when week 43 becomes the current week (preferably the 1st work day of week 43). 
Once the CPO is converted into a scheduled receipt, it will be automatically be 
deleted during MRP next run.</font></p>
<p align="left" class="auto-style3">
<font face="Arial">Lower-level BOM requirements (so is this level 3 
item, Control Box) are maintained when MRP runs through the multi-levels BOM and 
creates allocation for each lower-level item required to support the scheduled 
receipt (level 0, Carriage Assy). The Projected Gross Requirements (demand), 
Projected Available Balance (supply), and Planned Order Release (supply) are 
calculated by MRP system; only the Scheduled Receipts are maintained by the 
master scheduler.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2" class="auto-style3">In situation when the <b>PAB</b> goes negative and 
then returns to positive, MRP recognizes that a timing problem exists (that is, 
there is enough supply orders, but just some of them are scheduled too late). In 
another situation when the <b>PAB</b> goes negative and stays negative, MRP 
recognizes that a volume problem exists and will recommend additional supply 
orders. Each time that MRP is run, this kind of analysis and calculation take 
place in the system and Exception Messages Reports are generated for 
scheduler/planers to take action. So in such calculation analysis, MRP would not 
recommend that the Computer Planned Order be released until we enter into week 
43.</font></p>

Available Balance</i></b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br><span class="auto-style3">For the master-scheduled item, 135 is the Beginning On-Hand Balance. 135 plus 
the Supply Orders or Scheduled Receipt in the MPS row (equals 0) in current 
week, minus the Total Demand (70+1) in current week, that gives the Ending 
Projected Available Balance (64) for current week. The projected available 
balance for week 40 through 47 are calculated the same way. There is a potential 
shortfall of 20 units to meet the expected demand (75) at end of week 45. But as 
you read down, you will understand how MRP and master scheduler attempt to 
resolve these supply-demand imbalances.</span></font></p>

<font color="#008000" size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>Calculating 
Available-To-Promise</i></b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br><span class="auto-style3">The first step is to take what is master-scheduled and subtract the commitments 
(orders booked but not yet shipped). Because forecast is not a commitment, it is 
generally dropped in the <font color="#000080"><a href="#ATP">
<font color="#0033CC">ATP</font></a></font><a href="#ATP"><font color="#0033CC"> 
calculation</font></a>. Working from right to left from week 47 in Figure 15.2, 
130 are master scheduled, and 0 are committed (no actual demand), so ATP is 130 
(130 - 0 =130). Using the same calculation, ATP in week 46 is 130, week 43 is 
97, and so on. </span> </font></p>
<p align="left" class="auto-style3">
<font face="Arial">The Green row shows non-cumulative ATP qty, and the 
Orange row shows cumulative ATP. To calculate a cumulative ATP or carry over the 
values, simply add the ATP from each period working left to right. Why do I do 
that? For example, if a customer calls and asks you how many Carriage Assy you 
can give him by week 47. At a glance on the ATP row, the answer is 497.</font></p>
<p align="left" class="auto-style3">
<font face="Arial">Because of the projected on-hand shortfall of -20 in 
week 45, and expected it to also fall below the safety stock level in week 46, 
the master scheduler has moved the 2 supply orders of 130 lot size up a week 
earlier to week 45 and week 46, to overcome the supply shortfall. Figure 15.3 
shows you, after MRP recalculates, that ATP in week 46 and 47 was now made 
available a week earlier. Week 45's ATP shows 125 because of the Actual Demand 
of 5 (130 &#8211; 5). The positive projected available balance in week 45 now shows no 
more supply deficit. </font></p>
<p align="left" class="auto-style3">
<font face="Arial">Figure 15.4 shows that the company has secured a 
huge booking and actual demand for week 45 has increased from 5 to 137 units. 
Since 130 units are master scheduled in week 45 and 137 have been committed, the 
resulting ATP is&nbsp; &#8211; 7 (130&#8211;137). Negative values in ATP are substituted 
with zero, and ATP in week 45 will become zero (the total master schedule in 
week 45 is consumed). To protect the entire commitment of the 132 units increase 
in demand, MRP will look at week 44 which has 237 ATP qty, while at the same MRP 
also suggests through Exception Message, to create supply order of an additional 
lot size in order to cover the the negative projected on-hand balance (-22) in 
week 45. By taking 7 out of the ATP 237 units for week 45 coverage, ATP would 
remain 230 in week 44. By working back into time, from week 45 to current week 
40, the scheduler/demand planner can use ATP to protect customer orders promises 
without committing current inventory any earlier than necessary.</font></p>
<p align="left" class="auto-style3">
<font face="Arial">Checking that there are enough material and no 
capacity constraints, the master scheduler acts on the Exception Message to 
create an additional Firm Planned Order of 130 units into week 45. As shown in 
Figure 15.5, the Scheduled Receipt becomes 260 in week 45, and there are now no 
more projected on-hand shortfall as well as none falls below the Safety Stock 
Level in all the 8 weeks.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<i><b><font color="#008000" face="Arial" size="3">Managing Safety Stock Level</font></b></i><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial"><br>I<span class="auto-style3">n SAP, you enter the desired safety stock values, 
and system flags any situation in which the projected on-hand balance falls 
below the safety stock level. In the MPS matrix, safety stock level is 
maintained at 50 per period.&nbsp; At a quick glance in Figure 15.2 tells you 
that in week 45 &amp; 46, the projected available balance is expected to fall below 
the safety stock level or turns negative (40 and -20). The expected available 
balance of -20 in week 45 [55 + MPS (equal 0) - Total Demand (75)] happened 
because there is no schedule receipt in week 45. </span> </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2" class="auto-style3">But why no? The master scheduler has placed a 
Planning Time Fence at end of week 45. By doing this, the master scheduler can 
control all the supply orders up through week 45, while MRP can only add or make 
changes beyond week 45. With a cumulative lead time of 6 weeks, the master 
scheduler wants these periods &quot;locked up&quot;, and not subject to some insensible 
changes recommended by MRP to balance out a deficiency in some other period 
without a more careful human analysis. Therefore, MRP can only place a Computer 
Planned Order (<b>CPO</b>) of 130 in week 46, but not in week 45. However, MRP 
outputs the Exception Message Report to the scheduler to shift the week 46's CPO 
of 130 into week 45, and convert it into Firm Planned Order (<b>FPO</b>). This 
is indicated by the arrowed box in Figure 15.2. Using the same logic, MRP also 
indicates in the Exception Message to move the week 47's CPO of 130 to week 46 
because the week 46's projected available balance (40) falls below safety stock 
level. These shifts would keep the projected available balance above 50 in all 
the 8 weeks as shown in Figure 15.3.</font></p>
<p align="left" class="auto-style3">
<font face="Arial">Company has booked an increase in demand for week 45 
by an additional 132 units (137&#8211;5) as shown in Figure 15.4. This cause the 
projected available balance for week 45 through 47 to fall below the Target 
Safety Stock Level (-22, 38 and -32). As MRP is restricted from creating a 
supply order in week 45 (inside the planning time fence) to address the PAB 
supply deficit of -22, so MRP suggests through Exception Message to the 
scheduler to create an FPO or Released Order of 130 as indicated by the arrowed 
box. There was no material and capacity issues, the master scheduler created and 
released an Firm Planned Order of 130 units into week 45. MRP recalculated, the 
Scheduled Receipt in MPS row now becomes 260 units in week 45 as shown in Figure 
15.5, and the MPS matrix shows there are no more projected available balance 
that falls below the Safety Stock Level in all the 8 weeks.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial"><i><b><font color="#008000" size="3">Managing Planning Time 
Fence (PTF)</font></b></i></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br>I<span class="auto-style3">n Figure 15.2, PTF was being placed at end of week 45. The purpose of placing 
this planning time fence is to restrict MRP from automatically adding Computer 
Planned Orders (<b>CPO</b>) within that specified time zone. Only Released 
Orders and Firm Planned Orders can be created within PTF's close-in periods, and 
the master scheduler controls this. MRP thus can only settle for placing enough
<b>CPO</b>s into week 46, to create a positive Projected Available Balance, and 
informs the scheduler by means of Exception Message that a negative expected 
on-hand balance exists inside the planning time fence. The master scheduler must 
take action if the supply deficit in week 45 (expected on-hand shortfall of -20) 
is to be avoided. This supply deficit would increase by 70 per week through the 
planning horizon if no additional Firm Planned Orders (<b>FPO</b>) were placed 
(supply shortfall of -90 in week 46, -160 in week 47).</span></font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2" class="auto-style3">Before the scheduler converts the <b>CPO</b> of 130 
in week 46 into a Firm Planned Order, or directly into a Released Order with a 
due date in week 45, these things must be checked first -- ensure there are 
enough material and capacity to produce these 130 units in time, question the 
validity of the 70 units forecast, and who need to authorize to make this 
change.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#008000" size="3" face="Arial"><i><b>Managing Demand Time Fence 
(DTF)</b></i></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br><span class="auto-style3">A DTF is being placed at the end of week 42. Inside the DTF, demand will consist 
only of Actual Demand (committed customer orders with promised dates); forecast 
will be ignored between the current week 40 and the DTF. Outside the DTF, the 
Total Demand will then equal actual demand + forecasts (depends on forecast 
consumption technique used). For example, in Figure 15.2 you can see the 
projected available balance for week 42 and 43 are calculated differently using 
this DTF logic. DTF is strictly a mechanical means used to lock demand within 
the specified near&nbsp; periods with only booked orders (forecast should 
already more-or-less have turned into booked orders in current + next 2 weeks). 
Any changes to the master schedule with the DTF need formal approval from 
authorities higher than the master scheduler. Additional customer orders can 
still be promised inside the DTF if there enough ATP quantities. Beyond the DTF, 
the master scheduler can make changes to MPS, within the existing&nbsp; 
rescheduling rules. </span> </font></p>
