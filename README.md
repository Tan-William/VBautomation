The explanatory modules on MS Office Excel formulas, Inventory Management, Forecasting techniques - these are still very much applicable to modern days as the processes hardly vary, albeit these modules were written more than a decade or so ago. The only drawback is concerning the detailed works for Excel VBA and Access Database applications as some of the codes were written at that time based on Office 32-bit version and may run into some problems with MS Office 64-bit Excel and Access database applications. If you are able to modify some of the VB codes to run in your 64-bit MS Office Excel, they should work just as fine. Cheers !
