How to use...

Colors can be selected by using the scrollbars (red, green and blue),
or by entering hexadecimal or decimal code into the appropriate text
box and pressing the enter key to accept it.
Whichever way the color is selected, it will be automatically 
displayed in the box at the top-left corner of the screen, and will 
also be displayed both in decimal and hexadecimal code in the 
respective text boxes.

You can set the selected color to be displayed within the example box
to either the text color (foreground), or the background color.  This
can help find the best matching combination for use with HTML 
documents, or applets.  To set either text or background color, click 
on the "Set Foreground" and "Set Background" buttons.
Also, you can obtain the current color shade, hex, and decimal code
for either foreground or background so that you can alter it.  To 
retreive either text or background color, click on the "Get Foreground"
and "Get Background" buttons.
